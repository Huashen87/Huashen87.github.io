# About Me

I am Huashen, a software engineer with almost 2 years of experience working for a startup software company. My primary responsibilities include backend development, and I am skilled in Golang and TypeScript programming languages. I am familiar with database systems such as MySQL/MariaDB, PostgreSQL, and have worked on developing blockchain applications and ERP systems. I also have experience using tools such as Linux, Git, AWS, Docker, and Unity 3D. Additionally, I am proficient in React.js for web frontend development and familiar with modern web development processes. I am good at self-learning, team communication, analyzing requirements, problem-solving, and quickly grasping key points and learning new knowledge.

Currently, I plan to pursue a master's degree in computer science and have a strong interest in compilers, databases, systems programming, and software engineering.
